# Javascript Password Generator

## Project by MinhThu Nguyen ##

## Description:

**The user will be presented with:**
- specific criteria for the choice of password length of 8-128 characters. 
- to include/not include lowercase letters
- to include/not include uppercase letters
- to include/not include numerics
- to include/not include special symbols 

After selecting the desired criterias, a unique password will be generated.
